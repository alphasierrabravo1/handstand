# handstand
A simple program to calculate the forces involved in a handstand.

This program was created as part of a project to determine the minimum angle that is achievable while executing a handstand. The write up of the project is located on medium.com under the title "A Simple Model for the Handstand" for context (https://medium.com/@abrown18_68137/a-simple-model-for-the-handstand-1c775286c3bf). The goal of the project is to calculate the amount of force required to remain in a handstand by two main muscle groups in the hands/wrists. The values for force depend on the values that the user inputs, and are contextualized using average data for palmar pinch strength as well as weight forces. 

The reason why a program was created to execute rather basic equations is due to the nature of the trigonometry involved in the project. The evaluation of the trigonometry depends on certain constants that are defined by what the user inputs in the beginning of the program. The use of if/else statements helped to streamline the calculation process. From here, the program evolved into something that presented contextualized data to the user.

This program uses Python 3 - simply run it and answer the series of prompts that are provided. As a result you will be able to determine what angles of a handstand are possible for you!
